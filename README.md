...and here you are!
Welcome to my GitHub! This is where I throw all my projects—some from 42 Barcelona, where I'm currently studying, and others from my random coding adventures.

## 🌱 About me  
🎓 Learning C and C++ at **42 Barcelona**, dreaming of becoming a **Software Engineer**  
🛠️ Exploring **JavaScript, TypeScript, APIs, and databases** in my free time  
🤖 Super curious about **AI and tech** in general  
🌍 Based in **Barcelona** (yes, the weather is great 😎)  

## 🔥 What you’ll find here  
**School projects** – because debugging C at 3 AM is a rite of passage  
**Side projects** – where I experiment, break things, and (hopefully) learn new stuff
